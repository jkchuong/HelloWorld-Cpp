# Hello C++

This repository is to store my notes and studies while teaching myself C++. The main resources I will be using are:

- [Learn C++](https://www.learncpp.com/)

- [Beginning C++ Programming - From Beginner to Beyond](https://www.udemy.com/course/beginning-c-plus-plus-programming/)

For further studies, I plan to use:

- [Effective C++](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Effective-Specific-Programs-Professional-Computing/dp/0321334876)

- [Game Programming Patterns](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Game-Programming-Patterns-Robert-Nystrom/dp/0990582906/ref=sr_1_1?crid=25WF7C1QZ245L&keywords=Game+Programming+patterns&qid=1655414855&s=books&sprefix=game+programming+patterns%2Cstripbooks%2C63&sr=1-1)

For personal projects, I will aim to create the following console apps:

- Minesweeper + automated minesweeper player

- Hangman using random word from text file

- Tic Tac Toe 

Areas of understanding that needs improvements:

- Manipulating raw pointers

- Using Constructors (Deep/Shallow copy, Move)

- When to use pointers? (Only uniquely valuable for Polymorphism?)
